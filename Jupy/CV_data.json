Main part of this project revolves around a photo diode (IR LED) for Transmission and phototransistor (L14FI) for reception. For our convenience, we have useda Melody generator IC (BT66T-19L) as a signal generator. It is then amplified and transmitted Through IR LED. As for reception process, the incoming infrared signal is captured by Phototransistor, amplified using LM741 and LM386 and fed to the loudspeaker. Here, photo Diode and phototransistor act as transducer, converting electrical sign l to light pulse and vice- Versa. Project-2: Private Automatic Branch Exchange [PABx] Deseription: This project is a microcontroller based Private Automatic Branch Exchange. Main devices used In this project are: (1) a microcontroller [AT89C5 1], (2) DTMF Decoder [MT8879], (3) Relay Driver [ULN2003 APG],. (4) Ring Detector [4N26], (5) Tone Generator (CD4093). This system Performs the necessary switching operations for exchange of call. Microcontroller continuously Monitors the status of telephone sets connected with the system and performs all the required Functions when a call is initiated. DTMF Decoder converts the incoming DTMF signal into its Corresponding binary format and send to microcontroller. Relay cannot be driven by Microcontroller alone, hence a Relay Driver is used. Ring Detector alerts the microcontroller About incoming external call. To provide Busy Tone and Dial Tone to the telephone line, a Tone Generator is used. This system allows all employees to share phone system lines, thus reducing O erall telecommunication expenses. It is a fully automatic system, so it doesn’t need any Manual operator.
