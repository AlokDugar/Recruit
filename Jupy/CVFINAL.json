Main part of this project revolves around a photo diode (IR LED) for Transmission and phototransistor (L14FI) for reception. For our convenience, we have useda Melody generator IC (BT66T-19L) as a signal generator. It is then amplified and transmitted Through IR LED. As for reception process, the incoming infrared signal is captured by Phototransistor, amplified using LM741 and LM386 and fed to the loudspeaker. Here, photo Diode and phototransistor act as transducer, converting electrical sign l to light pulse and vice- Versa. Project-2: Private Automatic Branch Exchange [PABx] Deseription: This project is a microcontroller based Private Automatic Branch Exchange. Main devices used In this project are: (1) a microcontroller [AT89C5 1], (2) DTMF Decoder [MT8879], (3) Relay Driver [ULN2003 APG],. (4) Ring Detector [4N26], (5) Tone Generator (CD4093). This system Performs the necessary switching operations for exchange of call. Microcontroller continuously Monitors the status of telephone sets connected with the system and performs all the required Functions when a call is initiated. DTMF Decoder converts the incoming DTMF signal into its Corresponding binary format and send to microcontroller. Relay cannot be driven by Microcontroller alone, hence a Relay Driver is used. Ring Detector alerts the microcontroller About incoming external call. To provide Busy Tone and Dial Tone to the telephone line, a Tone Generator is used. This system allows all employees to share phone system lines, thus reducing O erall telecommunication expenses. It is a fully automatic system, so it doesn’t need any Manual operator.

(Duration: 1 Year) (As M.E. thesis work) OFDM has been adopted by many wireless communication standards like ADSL, IEEE 802.11 a/ g/ n, DAB, DVB, IEEE 802.16 (i.e. WiMax) ete due to its several advantageous features in multipath environments. One of the major drawbacks of OFDM is its inherent high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). In this thesis, a new hybrid technique has been proposed for the reduction of PAPR in the OFDM system. The proposed technique is a combination of pre-coding and partial transmits sequence (PTS). The proposed method achieves a considerable reduction in PAPR then PTS method with less complexity. Simulation results are presented and compared on the basis of the CCDF (complementary cumulative distribution function), PSD (power spectral density), and BER (bit error rate).

Completed Intermediate Level in Distr division with 80.16%. Completed Project on Low Cost Automatic Gate Alarm, It is an IR based project which automatically sounds the alarm by sensing the presence of a person. This circuit consists of two stages: A transmitting unit consisting of two IR LEDs and a sensing unit consisting of an IR sensor. When any person tries to enter the gate, IR beam gets interrupted. As a result the bell is turned on to sound the alarm. Tribhuwan University, Institute of Engineering, Paschhimanchal Campus (W.R.C), 2013 AD.. Bachelor Degree in Electronics and Communication (BE), Completed Bachelor Level in 1\"division with 67.16%. Completed Minor Project on Token Number Display System, It is a microcontroller based project consisting of two switches, a 7-segment display and a buzzer. The decade counter is incremented when a switch is pressed and its corresponding value is displayed in a 7-segment display with a buzzing sound. Another switch resets the counter when the counter reaches the count of nine, to zero and the counting process restarts. Completed Major Project on Check-post Control using Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR), It is a microcontroller based system which captures the image of a license plate and distinguishes between authenticated and unauthenticated vehicles comparing the captured image of the license plate with the pre-maintained database of the license plates and then either opens the check post or closes according to the result of comparison.
