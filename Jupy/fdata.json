Voice of Children (VOC) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization established on November 2000 with a mission to contribute for the improvement of the living condition of the Street Children and their families in Nepal. The organization mainly focuses on those children, who suffer from various kinds of problems such as sexual abuse, harassment and other forms of violence and exploitation in the street and strives to re-establish them in the society with special attention to their needs and rights. Assistance in different ways and through different programs focused on the enhancement of the physical, mental, social and financial condition is catered to the needy street children and their families in order to reshape their lives. DETAILED JOB DESCRIPTION / REQUIREMENTS: Terms of Reference, CLARISSA Project - Professional Research Support Team. Title: Participatory Action Research - Consultant. Organisation: Voice of Children (VoC). Reports To: Country Coordinator – CLARISSA. Based: Kathmandu with frequent travel to field. Duration: July to December 2020. 1.  About VOC: VOC is an organization working especially with children living/working in the street & their families, to protect the children from sexual abuse and build-up the capacity of the vulnerable families of the urban poor area to protect their children. Over the 18 years, VOC has expanded and developed other projects complementary to working with street children such as prevention of child sexual abuse and working with vulnerable poor families in vulnerable communities. VOC is now implementing Child Labour Action-Research-Innovation (CLARISSA) programme in Nepal as a consortium lead. 2. Background of the CLARISSA: Child Labour Action-Research-Innovation (CLARISSA) programme is co-developing, with stakeholders, innovative and context-appropriate ways to increase options for children to avoid engagement in hazardous, exploitative labour in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal. It is designed to generate innovation from the ground, which can sustainably improve the lives of children and their families. Its focus is on surfacing key drivers of the worst forms of child labour and developing interventions to counteract them (preventing push factors at community, family and individual level and pull factors from unethical business). The primary beneficiaries are children in the worst forms of child labour and those who are vulnerable to being drawn into it. The families of these children will benefit from greater resilience to shocks, better options for their children’s safe and healthy future and less intra-family stress and conflict. Businesses will benefit from practical solutions to child-labour free supply chains. Policymakers, NGOs, and researchers will benefit from a knowledge of what works. 3.  Participatory Action Research (PAR) for innovation: Under the project, there will be three main models of PAR including narrative analysis, supply/human chain and hotspots / slums location tracking. As part of the participatory process life story collection is one of the methods that we will use to gather real information and learn about what happened and or what is happening in their life specially child and young people in the CLARISSA project. These stories will help us to understand how the children and their families build resilience and find solutions to the problems that they have faced. Together with beneficiaries and key stakeholders these stories will be analysed through collective story analysis process. Furthermore, we will generate actions and interventions through a large-scale systematic action research process. Interventions will range from small scale solutions to local problems, behaviour change initiatives, and large-scale pilots. Action research is a programming modality which combines evidence gathering and learning from action. It is designed to enable diverse groups to meet over a period to consider evidence and generatetheories of change about interventions; plan and  programme innovative solutions; test the solutions in real-time, and participatorily evaluate them. In this way, action research groups act as engines of new innovation. These cycles of action and reflection continue until a robust model of action is developed, trialled and can be scaled.We will link multiple and parallel action research groups to form a sophisticated architecture for adaptive learning and management (systemic action research) and will ensure that children are central to this process. Our aim is to co-develop, with children and families, innovative and context-appropriate ways to increase options for children to avoid engagement in hazardous exploitative labour with the impact of decreasing the numbers of children engaging in the worst forms of child labour, modern slavery and risky migration and improving child wellbeing. 4.
